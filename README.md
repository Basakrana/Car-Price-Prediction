## 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on multiple features like mileage, engine capacity, power, ownership, and fuel type. The model is built using machine learning techniques to help customers and businesses estimate the fair value of a vehicle.

## 📌 Project Overview

The second-hand car market often struggles with inconsistent pricing. Buyers and sellers face difficulty in deciding the right price due to multiple influencing factors such as car age, fuel efficiency, and ownership history. This project solves that problem by applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms to build a robust car price prediction system.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of 8,128 rows and the following columns:

name → Car brand and model name

year → Year of manufacture

selling_price → Price of the car (target variable)

km_driven → Kilometers driven

fuel → Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, LPG, Electric)

seller_type → Type of seller (Dealer, Individual, Trustmark Dealer)

transmission → Gear type (Manual, Automatic)

owner → Ownership status (First, Second, Third, etc.)

mileage → Fuel efficiency (kmpl or km/kg)

engine → Engine capacity (in CC)

max_power → Maximum engine power (in bhp)

torque → Torque output of the engine

seats → Number of seats in the vehicle

## ⚙️ Features of the Project

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting categorical variables, feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Studying price trends across fuel types, brands, and years.

Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Evaluation Metrics: R², RMSE, and MAE to compare models.

Deployment: Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Visualization:  Seaborn

Deployment: Streamlit

## 📊 Key Insights

Cars lose value rapidly in the first few years.

Diesel cars generally have higher resale value than petrol cars.

Automatic cars are priced higher compared to manual ones.

More previous owners → Lower resale value.
